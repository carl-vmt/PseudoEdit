# PseudoEdit

## An old memory

PseudoEdit was my first humble attempt to create a real app, instead of just doing coding tasks.
I did this over the time I was in Rendcomb, an english boarding-school, where it was a project I did for my teacher.
When I left Rendcomb, I stopped working on this project, but it is a nice little memory.

## The program
  
PseudoEdit is a text editor that enables you to write Pseudo Code way faster and easier than any normal text editor.  
It provides syntax highlighting, finds common errors and suggests auto-completions while you're typing.
