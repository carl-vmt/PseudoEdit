FEATURES

Feature #1:
While you type, the program should suggest auto completions.

Feature #2:
If a variable is assigned, it should be highlighted later in the script.
If a variable is used before it's assigned, it should be marked as an error.
If a variable is assigned more than one time, it should be marked as an error.


ISSUES

Issue #1:
If you paste multiple lines at once, they all get added into a single line and basically break the editor.
Copying works and pasting single lines works as well.
